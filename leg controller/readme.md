A modded version of the "Leg Controller" module created by Road_Gamer2.

This modded version is designed to run in parallel and to automatically create/destroy leg controllers for all player characters created.
Along with this, i've also removed the torso tilting since i didn't need it. 
A few small optimizations have also been added.
